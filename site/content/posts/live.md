After some initial struggles, I decided to bring this blog to life.

## What to Expect?
There will be an initial blog post on why I started this blog—I already wrote it! I will also write a separate one on why it took so long, but for today, I’ll call it a day. I am glad, happy, and also relieved that it finally went live. See you soon, and don’t forget to check back in a few days!
